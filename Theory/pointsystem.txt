The formula for cardiac health indicator as devised by me is,
        sum of deviation of the different heath indicators for an individual from the actual value.

if the score is zero this means there is no deviation, and all is fine but in case there is significant deviation,
more than five for each then the following formula will give a non zero term and we will get a non zero cardiac health number.

   formula = sigma of( (actual value which is not in correct range - ideal value)/5 ).
